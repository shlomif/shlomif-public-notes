Hi Gergely!

Ping! Can the python-pysol_cards package be sponsored by you?

I'd like to get the new freecell-solver release (
https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/releases/tag/freecell-solver-6.2.0
) packaged in debian before the https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBullseye
freeze. Also note that my mother said once that "The lazy man ends up
working twice as hard.". investing the time to do something as best as
possible at first often ends up saving time later. (Sorry if I'm being
too preachy.)

Gergely is https://nm.debian.org/person/risko/ ;I'm not sure whether "Risko"
or "Gergely" are his first name, and which ones he prefers to be called by.
He is the Debian maintainer of https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/freecell-solver
and noted that the upstream source requires some new build deps.
