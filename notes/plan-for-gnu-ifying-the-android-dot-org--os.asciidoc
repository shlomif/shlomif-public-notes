Proto-plan for making the android.org OS more GNU-based
=======================================================

One problem with the Android mobile operating system ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29 )
is that it is a GNU-like-system but-almost-entirely-unlike-GNU/Linux ( to paraphrase on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_GalaxyÂ ). This makes
developing for it unnecessarily harder (even if it is better than developing
for Symbian or iOS, but "good is the enemy of great").

I was told the reason is political and legal (avoiding gnu.org copylefted code due to the
FSF concern for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization ), so it is partly a human-made
problem.

Can the FSF negotiate a pledge/contract with android.org (that shall apply for
everyone) to make the gnu.org runtime suitable with it? (And gradually make
android a bonafide gnu/linuxy system) It could be version 3.1 of the GPL/LGPL or
something else (IANAL/etc.)

I realise every two lawyers have three opinions but I think most lawyers are good and
smart people, who have better things to do than create artificial problems. (See
"I never met a monster I didn't like" on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQALLGsn-Fk .)

Yet another anecdote is the acrophyical lawsuit over the large inheritance of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennens between two branches of his
family that has continued for well over a century and ended up when all
the money was consumed by lawyer fees. While this has made many lawyers
slightly "richer", it also likely made them busy performing tasks
they'd rather not do (see: "amateur" as someone who enjoys his work
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=paul-graham-what-ameteur-meant )
more grumpy and unhappy. "You can no more win a lawsuit than you can win an eathquake."

Thanks!
