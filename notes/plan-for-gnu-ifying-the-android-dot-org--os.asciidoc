Proto-plan for making the android.org OS more GNU-based
=======================================================

One problem with the Android mobile operating system ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29 )
is that it is a GNU-like-system but-almost-entirely-unlike-GNU/Linux ( to paraphrase on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_GalaxyÂ ). This makes
developing for it unnecessarily harder (even if it is better than developing
for Symbian or iOS, but "good is the enemy of great").

I was told the reason is political and legal (avoiding gnu.org copylefted code due to the
FSF concern for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization ), so it is partly human-made
problem.

Can the FSF negotiate a pledge/contract with android.org (that shall apply for everyone) to make the gnu.org runtime suitable with it? (And gradually make android a bonafide gnu/linuxy system)

I realise every two lawyers have three opinions but I think most lawyers are good and
smart people, who have better things to do than create artificial problems. (See
