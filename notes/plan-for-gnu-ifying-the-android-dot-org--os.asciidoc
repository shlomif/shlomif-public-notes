Proto-plan for making the android.org OS more GNU-based
=======================================================

One problem with the Android mobile operating system ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29 )
is that it is a GNU-like-system but-almost-entirely-unlike-GNU/Linux ( to paraphrase on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_GalaxyÂ ). This makes
developing for it unnecessarily harder (even if it is better than developing
for Symbian or iOS, but "good is the enemy of great").
