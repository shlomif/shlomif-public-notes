I am seeking a new laptop to replace my aging Acer Laptop -
see http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#computers-specs . I've been pretty
happy with it but some of its keys have been malfunctioning lately and it only
has 3 GB of RAM, which is getting low.

What I want is a recommendation for a laptop model with the following
requirements:

- Not a MacBook/Apple:
    - See http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/apple/
    - Costly
    - Many Hardware Problems Reported
    - May not support Linux well
    - Gotten downhill (no Esc/function keys, soldered hard disk)
- AMD/ATI or Intel Graphics
    - Nvidia is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_36yNWw_07g and I had a bad personal experience with their drivers.
    - Not much into hardcore gaming, but may wish to use OpenCL/etc. in the future.
- 16 GB of RAM at the very least with 24 GB, 32 GB or more preferable
- CD/DVD/BluRay not required
    - I can use USB ports
