I am seeking a new laptop to replace my aging Acer Laptop -
see http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#computers-specs . I've been pretty
happy with it but some of its keys have been malfunctioning lately and it only
has 3 GB of RAM, which is getting low.

What I want is a recommendation for a laptop model with the following
requirements:

- Not a MacBook/Apple:
    - See http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/apple/
    - Costly
    - Many Hardware Problems Reported
    - May not support Linux well
    - Gotten downhill (no Esc/function keys, soldered hard disk)
- AMD/ATI or Intel Graphics
    - Nvidia is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_36yNWw_07g and I had a bad personal experience with their drivers.
    - Not much into hardcore gaming, but may wish to use OpenCL/etc. in the future.
- 16 GB of RAM at the very least with 24 GB, 32 GB or more preferable
- CD/DVD/BluRay not required
    - I can use USB ports
- Will run a GNU/Linux OS:
    - Hopefully Mageia 6/7 or Fedora.
    - Experiences with other distributions are fair game as well.
    - Not an FSF purist (I mean https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html )
    - I am fine with most "non-free" firmware
- Uses:
    - Plasma 5 (KDE) desktop with a fallback on Xfce and JWM.
    - VirtualBox/KVM/etc. virtual machines
    - Desktop effects
    - Software development.
        - gcc/g++
        - python / pypy
        - node.js
        - Perl 5 / CPAN
        - gvim / vim / neovim
        - bash / zsh / konsole
    - Freecell/solitaire/etc. research
        - need RAM!
    - Firefox and to a lesser extent chromium-browser
    - Hexchat
    - Pidgin
    - VLC and mpv
    - gwenview
- I don't mind paying the Microsoft tax, but probably won't use Windows 10 much
