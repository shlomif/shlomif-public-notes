I am seeking an application to populate a directory tree with files based
on some customisations, configurations, plugins and plugin-bundles.

[Dist-Zilla](http://dzil.org/) comes closest to what I want, but I need:

1. For it to take place in the current directory while not creating a pristine
temporary build directory.

2. Not be as centric to generating CPAN distributions.
