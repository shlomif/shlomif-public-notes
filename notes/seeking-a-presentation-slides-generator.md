I am seeking an application to generate HTML slides.

Some of the requirements or nice-to-haves are:

1. Be able to generate valid HTML/CSS/JS/etc.

2. I am willing that it will require enabling/whitelisting JavaScript.

3. A succinct documentation format such as [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) .

4. Allow to embed images, syntax highlighted code excerpts, etc.
