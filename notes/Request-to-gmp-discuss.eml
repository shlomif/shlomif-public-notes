Hi!

Thanks for maintaining GNU MP gmplib.org and its email infrastructure, and=
 for accepting the first copy of my post, and I'm sorry for sending more t=
han one. The problem I faced was that although I was subscribed:

1. The post didn't arrive at the archive for several days.

2. I didn't get a bounce that it was rejected.

3. I didn't get a notice that it was held for moderation.

4. Sending an email from my gmail address to gmp-discuss-owner asking for =
the status bounced/was rejected as spam.

5. I couldn't find any other (and hopefully more reliable) medium than ema=
il for contacting GNU MP's developers on https://gmplib.org/ .

---------

So while ideally I wish that I could submit only one copy of the post and =
it would have promptly arrived at the list and the archive, I assumed it w=
as silently classified as spam and dropped (or similar).

I suggest fixing one or more of the issues I faced in order to prevent fur=
ther dissatisfaction by all parties.

Thanks again.

Best regards,
