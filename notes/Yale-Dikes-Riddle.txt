Alice, Bob, Carly, Dave, and Evelyn are taken to the police station for questioning. Detectives know that one of them is the thief and that only one of them tells the truth.

Alice says, "I am not the thief."
Bob says, "Alice is the thief."
Carly says, "I am the thief."
Dave says, "Carly is the thief."
Evelyn says, "I am not the thief"

Who is the thief?

============

Solution:

If what Carly said is true, then so does what Dave said is, so there'll be
two true statements. Therefore they are both false.

Now we know that Carly cannot be the thief.

What Alice and Bob say contradict each other , so one of these statements
must be the true one. As a result, Evelyn's statement is false, and she is
the thief.
